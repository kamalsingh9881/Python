    "1. What are the differences between operators and values in the following?\n",
    "*\toperator\n",
    "'hello'\tvalue\n",
    "-87.8\tvalue\n",
    "-\toperator\n",
    "/\toperator\n",
    "+\toperator\n",
    "6\tvalue\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \tOperators are the symbols in programming language which tells compiler or interpreator to perform specific assignment , logical, relational and mathmatical operation whereas values are the are the entities which can be manuplated or those entites in which some operations can be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "Spam \tvariable\n",
    "'spam'  \tdatatype\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\tString is a datatype which holds sequence of characters wheres variables is a memory locations consist a name to extract the data that will hold in this memory location.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe three different data forms.\n",
    "Ans: \t\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer : this form of data contains all the integers either positve or negative\n",
    "String : this form of data contains the sequence of characters may or may not be same\n",
    "Boolean: this form of data contains two values either true or false\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What makes up an expression? What are the functions of all expressions?\n",
    "Ans:\tExpression is a combination of constants, variable, operators and functions. All expressions are used by interpreter to manuplate data.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "5. In this chapter, assignment statements such as spam = 10 were added. What's the difference between a declaration and an expression?\n",
    "Ans:\tDeclaration is informing compiler about the details of a variable, functions like their name and the data they holds and expression are used by interpreter to manuplate data\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "Ans . \t22\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "'spam' * 3\n",
    "Ans.\tOutput of both will be ‘spamspamspam’\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is it that eggs is a true variable name but 100 is not?\n",
    "Ans.\tBecause variable name cant be a constant it should be a charter, symbol or sequence of character without space therfore 100 is not a variable it’s a value \n",
    "\n",
    "9. Which of the following three functions may be used to convert a value to an integer, a floating-point number, or a string?\n",
    "Ans.\tFor integer Int(), for floting point number float() , for string  str()\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the error caused by this expression? What would you do about it?\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "Ans.\tCan only concatenate str (not “int”) to str\n"
